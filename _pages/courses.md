## Online Courses

When COVID-19 hit and the world went into lockdown in 2020, I enrolled in multiple online courses in the summer break to enhance my knowledge and skill set. Fortunately, on;line platforms like [Coursera]() and [edX]() provided enrollment for multiple courses free of charge (for college students) upto a certain time period and I took full advantage of this opportunity and enrolled in various courses that captured my interest. Some of them are:
- **Natural Language Processing Specialization by deeplearning.ai** (5 courses) [[CERTIFICATE]]()
