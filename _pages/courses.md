As I've completed 3.5 years as an undergraduate student, I've taken a few courses (both in college as well as online certifications) to learn and expand my knowledge base. I've listed some select courses below, which are mostly relevant to my interests.

## College Courses

Some of the relevant courses I have taken at IIIT-Delhi are listed below. They are listed in the format of *course name (semester, instructor, grade received)*:
- [**CSE663A: Meta-Learning**](https://sites.google.com/view/meta-learning3/){:target="_blank"} *(Winter'22, Prof. Gautam Shroff, A)*
- **CSE642: Advanced Machine Learning** *(Monsoon'21, Prof. Saket Anand, A)*
- **CSE556: Natural Language Processing** *(Monsoon'21, Prof. Md. Shad Akhtar, A)*
- **CSE564: Reinforcement Learning** *(Monsoon'22, Prof. Sanjit Kaul, A)*
- **CSE515: Bayesian Machine Learning** *(Monsoon'22, Prof. Ranjitha Prasad, A+)*
- **CSE656: Information Integration and Applications** *(Monsoon'21, Prof. Mukesh Mohania, A)*
- **CSE222: Analysis and Design of Algorithms** *(Winter'21, Prof. Syamantak Das, A)*

- **MTH204: Differential Equations** *(Winter'21, Prof. Ashish Pandey, A)*
- **MTH203: Multivariate Calculus** *(Monsoon'21, Prof. Sarthok Sircar, A)*
- **CSE201: Advanced Programming** *(Monsoon'21, Prof. Vivek Kumar, A-)*
- **CSE102: Data Structures and Algorithms** *(Winter'20, Prof. Subhabrata Samajder, A-)*

<p class="panel-note" markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Aside:</b> Since I took a few ML courses on online platforms (as listed below) in my 2nd year, I didn't take *CSE343: Machine Learning* or *CSE641: Deep Learning* at IIIT-D because I had covered the basics of these courses elsewhere. Instead, I directly jumped into 
*CSE642: Advanced Machine Learning* and *CSE663A: Meta-Learning*, both of which required ML and DL as prerequisites and were more advanced in nature (especially since I was the only 3rd-year undergrad in a class of mostly Masters and Ph.D. students). These two courses were extremely enjoyable and well-taught, and I learned a lot from both of them.</p>

## Online Courses

When COVID-19 hit and the world went into lockdown in 2020, I enrolled in multiple online courses in the summer break to enhance my knowledge and skill set. Fortunately, online platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/){:target="_blank"} and [edX](https://www.edx.org/){:target="_blank"}  provided enrollment for multiple courses free of charge (for college students) up to a certain time period. I took full advantage of this opportunity and enrolled in various courses that captured my interest.
- **Natural Language Processing Specialization by deeplearning.ai** *(4 courses, completed November 2020)* [[CERTIFICATE]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/L9DY4PSQAC7Z){:target="_blank"}
- **MITx 6.86x: Machine Learning with Python-From Linear Models to Deep Learning** *(completed December 2020)* [[CERTIFICATE]](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/dd1078bb4d204a948a19ffef2b1fc960){:target="_blank"}
- **Applied Data Science with Python Specialization by University of Michigan** *(5 courses, completed October 2020)* [[CERTIFICATE]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/7GH3V8T337YJ){:target="_blank"}
